                        <p> I am a father of four incredible children and a husband to the most wonderful woman in the world. I was a mechanic for 13 years after I was medically discharged from the Army in 2006. While I was a mechanic I developed a variety of useful skills such as attention to detail, diagnostics, using hand tools etc. In 2019, I lost the job I had due to a family member coming ill. During this time, I realized that I was struggling to work at a good pace to keep up with the industry and maintain a steady income. I started talking with the Vocational Rehabilitation section of the Department of Veterans Affairs and found that I was ready to go back to school and rediscover myself in a new industry. After taking a vocational battery, I found that I have a strength with technology and a natural alignment with writing webpages. Just to see if this would be a good fit for me, I started studying HTML and CSS on my own through W3Schools, freeCodeCamp, and AppAcademy.io were the main tutorials that I went through, as well as a few others.
                            
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="row mt-3">
                            <p> Ultimately, This led me to deciding to further my education and pursue a bachelor's degree in Information Technology, with a focus on a Multi-Tier Architectural Approach. I started my education at Colorado State University - Global. I realized that this school had a lot to offer, however, the degree path was not completely in-line with what I wanted for my future. I did more research and found American Military University, and they have a program designed for exactly what I want to do with my future. Since I started my path at AMU, I have learned intro Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, UI/UX, SDLC, and some core classes. My degree includes a full understanding of front end technologies and backend development with Python, JavaScript and touches into Java. I plan to continue learning after I graduate to make the most of my skill-set and become a solid developer.
